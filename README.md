# Compose Tinder Card

![Banner image](/images/banner.png)

A Jetpack Compose `Modifier` that enables Tinder-like card gestures.

## Demo

## How to Install via Gradle

Add the following code in your `app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
repositories {
...
mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.alexstyl.swipeablecard:swipeablecard:0.1.0'
}
```

## How to use

Add the `Modifier.swipeableCard()` into your `@Composable` function to enable Tinder-like card gestures:

```kotlin
val state = rememberSwipeableCardState()

Box(
    modifier = Modifier
        .fillMaxSize()
        .swipableCard(
            state = state,
            onSwiped = { direction ->
                println("The card was swiped to $direction")
            },
            onSwipeCancel = {
                println("The swiping was cancelled")
            }
        )
) {
  // contents ...
}
```
The `SwipeableCardState` gives you access to the card's _offset_ so that you can create advanced animations according to the amount of swiping done.

The _swipedDirection_ gives you the direction the card has been fully swiped.

## How to swipe programmatically

Use the `SwipeableCardState` to swipe to a specific direction without a gesture:

```kotlin
val state = rememberSwipeableCardState()

// pass the state in your Modifier.swipeableCard(state)

val scope = rememberCoroutineScope()
Button(
    onClick = {
        scope.launch {
            state.swipe(Direction.Right)
        }
    }
) {
    Text("Like")
}
```

The `swipe()` suspend function will return, as soon as the swipe animation is finished.

## How to detect that a card has been swiped away

Use the `SwipeableCardState.swipedDirection`. You may want to combine it with a `LaunchedEffect()` in order to receive a callback when your card is swiped away (using a gesture or programmatically):

```kotlin
LaunchedEffect(state.swipedDirection){
    if(state.swipedDirection!=null) {
        println("The card was swiped to ${state.swipedDirection!!}")
    }
}
```

## Can I swipe towards any direction?

Yes. By default only horizontal swiping is allowed (left & right).

To control which directions need to be blocked, pass the respective Direction to the `blockedDirections` parameter of the `Modifier`.

```kotlin
val state = rememberSwipeableCardState()

Box(
    modifier = Modifier
        .swipableCard(
            // prevent swiping downwards. 
            blockedDirections = listOf(Direction.Down),
            state = state,
            onSwiped = { direction ->
                // ...
            },
            onSwipeCancel = {
                // ...
            }
        )
) {
  // contents ...
}
```
